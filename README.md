# CME538_Big_Project

This project aims to predict the outcomes of European football matches by leveraging machine learning, utilizing data from player attributes, team performance, financial expenditures, and betting odds. A comprehensive model was developed involving data collection through web scraping, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction to handle high-dimensional datasets. Despite the inherent unpredictability of football and challenges like imbalanced data, the model achieved accuracy comparable to existing works in the field, offering insights into the factors influencing match results and highlighting the difficulty of outperforming traditional bookmakers.
